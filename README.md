# Scientific Paper Summarizer

The Scientific Paper Summarizer is a tool designed to aid in the summarization of scientific papers, enabling users to quickly extract key information and generate concise summaries. It employs advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze the content of papers and distill essential insights.

## Features:

- **Automated Text Mining:** Utilizes TF-IDF algorithm to extract relevant text segments from scientific papers.
  
- **Content Generation:** Employs BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model for generating comprehensive summaries from mined text segments.

- **PowerPoint Presentation:** Integrates with the Python `pptx` library to create visually appealing PowerPoint slides containing the summarized content.

## Usage:

1. **Setup:**
   - Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

2. **Pre-trained Models:**
   - Download pre-trained BART models and configure the `transformers` library accordingly.

3. **Summarization:**
   - Run the summarization script, providing the path to the input scientific paper.

4. **Output:**
   - View the generated PowerPoint presentation (`summary.pptx`) containing the summarized content.
